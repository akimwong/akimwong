#### Method
A procedure or process for attaining an object

#### Research methodology
Is the justification (or explanation) for using a particular research method.

#### Research method
Is the strategy employed in the collection of data or evidence for analysis to uncover new information or arrive at a better understanding of a particular topic.

#### Type of methods:
1. Qualitative data analysis (aims to understand the problems being investigated in greater detail, and is often quite subjective). 
2. Quantitative data analysis (focuses on numerical, objective and repeatable data, and avoids subjectivity) <br/>

Process model that serves as the base for a data science process. 
It has six sequential phases: <br/>

2.1. Business understanding – What does the business need? <br/>
- Determine business objectives: You should first “thoroughly understand, from a business perspective, what the customer really wants to accomplish.” (CRISP-DM Guide) and then define business success criteria.
- Assess situation: Determine resources availability, project requirements, assess risks and contingencies, and conduct a cost-benefit analysis.
- Determine data mining goals: In addition to defining the business objectives, you should also define what success looks like from a technical data mining perspective.
- Produce project plan: Select technologies and tools and define detailed plans for each project phase. <br/>

2.2. Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean? <br/>
- Collect initial data: Acquire the necessary data and (if necessary) load it into your analysis tool.
- Describe data: Examine the data and document its surface properties like data format, number of records, or field identities.
- Explore data: Dig deeper into the data. Query it, visualize it, and identify relationships among the data.
- Verify data quality: How clean/dirty is the data? Document any quality issues. <br/>

2.3. Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling? <br/>
2.4. Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply? <br/>
2.5. Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives? <br/>
2.6. Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results? <br/>
