"The value of data scientists is their impact on a company and the outcomes their work produces." @KenJee_DS <br/>
"The true purpose of forecasting is not just to predict the future, but rather to tell you what actions to take in the present. <br/>
All of your forecasting tools should be built with that in mind."  @marktenenholtz
"1. Your fancy dashboards arenâ€™t useful if they donâ€™t drive action: A dashboard should answer a business question or help in decision-making. 2. Data quality matters more than AI.  Companies rush to implement AI without fixing their data pipelines. 3. Stakeholders donâ€™t care about your SQL skills.  They care about results. 4. Most companies donâ€™t use 80% of their data.  Organizations collect massive amounts of data but fail to use it effectively. 5. KPIs are often misleading.  Many businesses track the wrong metrics just because theyâ€™re easy to measure. 6. Data storytelling.  Your insights need a narrative. 7. Excel isnâ€™t going anywhere.  New BI tools emerge every year, but Excel remains the backbone of many companies. 8. AI wonâ€™t replace analystsâ€”bad analysts will be replaced.  AI can automate tasks, but it still needs human judgment, business acumen, and strategic thinking. 9. No one reads long reports.  If your insights canâ€™t be summarized in a one-slide takeaway, they will be ignored. 10. Most dashboards become graveyards.  A company spends weeks building a beautiful dashboardâ€”then no one uses it. 11. Correlation â‰  causation.  Just because two things move together doesnâ€™t mean one caused the other. 12. Your job isnâ€™t about dataâ€”itâ€™s about solving business problems.  Data is just the tool." @Eyowhite3
