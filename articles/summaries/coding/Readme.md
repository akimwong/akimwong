# How to Write Good Code Documentation for Data Scientists
(A crash course on the best practices you need to ensure that everyone understands the code you write)

#### Write step-by-step notes that describe how your code works and the steps you need to make the code work
- The notes that you write during the coding process will be the foundation upon which you develop your code documentation.
- These notes are then used to write your documentation and will offer the most accurate glimpse into your thought process. 
- These notes can be written in your code (most helpful, though do remember to clean them up when production time is near) or in a separate documentation file.
- The key here is to write down absolutely everything that comes to mind when writing your code, especially things that you may deem inconsequential to mention though could end up being game-changers in its later usages. 
- This includes items such as describing what each variable represents, what each function does, and the results the code should yield. 
- You will also want to include notes on why the code has to be written a certain way and in what order the functions are used and called.
