# How to Write Good Code Documentation for Data Scientists
(A crash course on the best practices you need to ensure that everyone understands the code you write)

#### Write step-by-step notes that describe how your code works and the steps you need to make the code work
- The key here is to write down absolutely everything that comes to mind when writing your code, especially things that you may deem inconsequential to mention though could end up being game-changers in its later usages. 
- This includes items such as describing what each variable represents, what each function does, and the results the code should yield. 
- You will also want to include notes on why the code has to be written a certain way and in what order the functions are used and called.

#### Assume that the person reading your code knows nothing
- One of the best things you can do when writing your code documentation is to write it as if the next person has no clue about anything to do with your code.
- This information could reside within the code (again, most helpful if coherent) or could reside in an external document.
- Short-form notes should be included within the code, whereas long-form explanations or descriptions are better left in an external document.

#### Use coding conventions and best practices
- This not only helps those after you to understand the code, but it also makes the code as production-ready as possible if and when that time comes.
- The key ideas to focus on when it comes to coding conventions and best practices are to:
1.	Use descriptive variable names.
2.	Use functions.
3.	Use comments (as discussed above).
4.	Use a consistent coding style.
5.	Use the syntax conventions of the language you use.
6.	Use libraries.
7.	Keep your code DRY.

#### Provide your contact information
- Providing your contact information at the end of your code or documentation is a simple, yet effective way of ensuring that any questions or issues are directed to you, which can help save time, money, and frustration.

#### Use flow-charts
- Viewing a process graphically can be an extremely effective way of understanding how it works
- These flow charts can be included in the external documentation for your code and should provide step-by-step instructions on how a function works, what it should return, and what should occur if something goes wrong or if a condition isn’t satisfied.

#### Practice describing how your code works so that a 5-year-old could understand it
- By reviewing your code documentation a few times before making it available, you ensure that you can explain your code as simply as possible through your literature and that you can explain it in more detail if questions ever arise.

#### What makes a “good code” exactly?

Best practices and principles to be particularly relevant and useful:
-	it takes minimal time and cost for new team members to join the project;
-	the code is written in a modular way and is version-controlled and unit-tested;
-	the application is fully configurable and contains no hard-coded values that control its execution;
-	the application is portable between execution environments;
-	the application is scalable without changing the tooling, architecture or development practices;
-	no code gets deployed in production without a peer review;
-	there is a monitoring infrastructure that allows one to track and understand how the application behaves in production.

#### Writing a perfect piece of code in one go is almost impossible, and that’s OK
- Having clearly formulated requirements in Data Science projects is uncommon.
