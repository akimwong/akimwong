# 7 Most Asked Questions on Central Limit Theorem
(Understanding the Importance of the Central Limit Theorem)
## 1. What is the Central Limit Theorem?
Given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution regardless of the data distribution in the population.
## 2. What is Sampling Distribution?
'Sampling distribution' describes the distribution of a sample statistic (e.g., the sample mean) over many samples from the same population (i.e., repeated sampling).
## 3. What are the conditions of the Central Limit Theorem?
1.	The sample size is sufficiently large.
2.	The samples are independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables.
3.	The population distribution has finite variance.
## 4. Does Central Limit Theorem work if the population distribution is NOT normal? Yes!
The sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as long as the sample size is `sufficiently large`. 
## 5. How large does the sample size need to be for the normal approximation to occur?
- The larger the sample size, the more closely the sampling distribution of the sample mean will follow a normal distribution.
- Typically, we consider a sample size of 30 to be sufficiently large.
•	If the sample size is less than 30, the central limit theorem doesn’t work anymore. The sampling distribution of the sample mean will follow normal distribution only if the population distribution is also normal.
•	If the sample size is greater than 30, the central limit theorem applies and the sampling distribution will follow normal distribution regardless of the population distribution. However, a strongly skewed distribution requires a larger sample size.
