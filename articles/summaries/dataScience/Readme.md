# Understanding the Business: The Data Science Skill We Don’t Talk About Enough
(Why you need to master this skill, and how to go about it)
- In the real world, data science projects start from a a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve.
- The data scientist’s job is to `translate a business problem into the *right* data science problem`. Then solve it.
- To do this you must:
1.	Ask questions, list possible solutions.
2.	Explore the data to narrow down the list to one (for example: ML + A/B Test, etc.)

'There is nothing more frustrating than building a great data science solution, to the wrong business problem.'

# How to Set Yourself Up For Success As a New Data Science Consultant With No Experience

#### Why fight hoards of applicants when you can create your own job?
- This guide will help you get the ball rolling toward developing your own data science consulting job.
- Data scientists, even those who just graduated, have a unique skill set that can be used to help clients in a variety of scenarios
- The `trick is to have the right amount of patience, tenacity, and resilience` to set up your consulting business

## 1. How to pick your specialty
- Despite the general requirement for data scientists to be “jacks of all trades”, working as a consultant means that you’ll want to pick a specialty to avoid going crazy with stress.
- `The key is to know what you’re good at and focus on it`.
- Do some market research to see where your niche could lay 
- While they say that data scientists should all be generalists in the beginning, I believe that consultants should focus on specializing themselves in niches that complement their skills and their alternative knowledge.
- Companies love working with consultants who have first-hand experience in their sector, so it can’t hurt to play to your strengths, past employment, education, or interest background.

## 2. How to market your skills
- The most simple checklist possible to begin marketing your skills is to: (1) build a portfolio; (2) begin networking; and (3) attend industry events. 
- One of the best pieces of advice I was given for having success at networking or industry events is to have a QR code on your business card that can take people directly to your portfolio or website. This is a great way to speed the connection process and helps direct potential customers to what’s important right from the beginning.

## 3.How to find clients
- The first way to find clients is to do pro bono work for small businesses in your area to develop some projects and gain credibility.
- The next way to get clients is to become the go-to data science consultant for clients. 
- The final way to begin getting clients as a new data science consultant is to bid for micro-projects with companies who are outsourcing work.

## 4. How to price your services
- Don’t undersell yourself.
- How do you demonstrate your quality and ability by working for peanuts?
- Pricing can be tricky given that there are several different ways for you to bill your services, for example:
1. You could bill hourly, on a monthly retainer, through set product pricing, through value-based fees, or through a pay-for-results model. Hourly billing is self-explanatory, as is the monthly retainer model where you work for a flat fee each month. 
2. Alternatively, you could sell your services via a suite of products that you sell at a flat fee or with varying prices for different tiers of products (think interactive dashboards, reports, advanced levels of customization, etc). 
3. Value-based pricing is set through an agreement between you and your client where they decide how much to pay you based on the value of your work for the company. 
4. The final way you could price your services is through a pay-for-results model where you don’t get paid if your services don’t improve the client’s business.

- As an entry-level data science consultant, you could look at charging between $200–250 per hour and begin charging upwards of $300 per hour as you gain more experience. 
- This will vary depending on the industry that you provide your unique services to, with a likely ability to increase your rate for clients in the oil and gas sector and a likely requirement to decrease your rate for small businesses.

# Top 10 Data Science Myths Busted
(The data science field is full of job opportunities, yet there is still a lot of confusion about what data scientists actually do. This confusion is largely due to the many myths that exist about the role of a data scientist. In this article, we will bust the top 10 myths about data science. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the role…)

## Myth 1. All data roles are the same
- Data analysts, data engineers and data scientists are all doing the same thing, which is completely wrong because their jobs, roles and responsibilities are all very different. 
- Data engineers: Their responsibility is to work on the basic engineering stuff and build those scalable data pipelines so that raw data can be extracted from multiple sources, transformed, and dumped into downstream systems. 
- Data scientists and data analysts: Rely on this process because they transform data into something that matters — the process of transforming data into information. While these people should appear to be doing the same thing, their skills may overlap, but their duties are fundamentally distinct.

## Myth 2. Ph.D. or Master’s Degree is required to become a Data Scientist
- It also depends a lot on the type of job role you want to get. 
- If we are looking for a role in research, for example, we need a master’s or Ph.D., but if you want to solve complex data problems and work around deep learning or machine learning, then you will be the one to work on the data science stuff using the libraries and using the data analysis approaches in order to create those complex data mysteries. 
- You don’t need to hold a Master’s Degree. Nowadays everything is all about skills so if you have the right skill set for the data scientist then you can definitely get into it.

## Myth 3. Data Scientists need to be a pro coder
- As a data scientist your job is to work on data extensively and when we talk about pro coding it means working too much on the competitive programming side or having a very in-depth knowledge of typical data structures and algorithms. 
- Surely a data scientist must have good complex problem-solving skills and in the world of data science, we have languages like Python and R which provide very important support through multiple libraries that can be used to solve complex data problems. 
- Your goal as a data scientist should be to understand how to use those libraries and their modules so that you can create the best data models and models related to machine learning. 
- The data scientist `must have these skills in order not to waste too much time` on competitive programming or practicing typical data structures and algorithms.

## Myth 4. Data Science is only for CS (Computer Science) graduates
- This is one of the most important myths that must be debunked.
- Companies do not focus on the typical technical skills of a programmer, but they want to understand if the candidates are good in the aptitude part, if they are able to understand the case studies, if they are able to understand what kind of business matrices they can extract from the data and what kinds of complex data-related problems they can solve.

## Myth 5. Data Science is only about predictive modeling
- Not everyone knows that data scientists `invest 80% of their time in cleaning and transforming` data and 20% of their time is dedicated to the data modeling part, so a data scientist who wants to create very accurate data as well as a machine learning model, he needs to clean and transformed data. 
- We know that when we work on a particular Big Data solution, there are multiple steps involved in it and the first and `very important part is transforming the data`. 
- Nowadays, we receive data from multiple sources, and the raw data sometimes contains errors, as well as junk records. If we cannot clean our data, we will not be able to obtain meaningful transformation data, and we will not be able to create machine learning models that are very accurate. 
- That’s why data science is not just about building the predictive model and regression models, it’s a good mix of cleaning and transforming the data, and then building accurate machine learning models.

## Myth 6. Data Science requires a strong mathematical background
- This is also completely not true because being good at math is one of the important parts of your day-to-day activities as a data scientist. 
- While analyzing the data we would need those mathematical concepts, let’s say aggregating the data statistics part, probability part, but that is something which is and not a must to have a skill set to become a data scientist. 
- We have amazing programming languages like Python and R which provides great support for amazing libraries as well which we can directly use in order to perform that typical mathematical calculation and computation so unless you need to innovate something, or you need to create any new algorithm you don’t need to be a mathematics expert.

## Myth 7. Learning a tool is enough to become a Data Scientist
- A good data science profile is a `combination of multiple skills, technical skills plus non-technical skills`. 
- Both are required to become good data scientists. In order to become a good data scientist, you cannot just rely on programming or any specific tool you think is being used in data science. If you are a good expert in both stuff, you are likely to become a good data scientist. 
- As data scientists, `we have to interact with multiple stakeholders when working on complex data problems`, and we must work directly with the business to gather all the requirements. 
- `Understanding the data domain, why we are processing it, what insights we can gain from the transform data, how to solve it, and what is relevant and what is irrelevant, are all necessary for this data science domain. Don’t think that only technical stuff or any specific tool like a language or a database is just enough to crack the data science profile. You need to use your non-technical skills and soft skills as your support system to become a good data scientist`.

## Myth 8. Companies are not hiring freshers for the data science role
- Freshers nowadays are self-aware and self-motivated, and they are very interested in exploring fields such as data science, and data engineering. 
- Instead of depending on others, they are putting their own effort into exploring these positions. 
- They are also taking participation actively in competitions in hackathons open source contributions and trying to build cool projects on their own. 
- That’s how they are able to acquire the right skill sets for the data science profile and also amazing dev skills. 
- That’s why now companies are preferring freshers to join them to cope with the vacancies in data science roles.

## Myth 9. Transitioning into data science domain is impossible from the different job profile
- If you come from a data-related background, let’s say you worked as a data engineer, data analyst, or business analyst then this transition will be easy for you because you already know about the data and how to work with it different tools and tech frameworks. 
- On the other hand, if you are coming from a different job profile as a testing profile or a software engineering profile then transitioning into data science will be challenging but not impossible. 
- `You need to work on a skill set you need to acquire and then work on some realistic projects that can help you in acquire new capabilities and develop your interest in the data science domain to understand how you really can add value to the company as a data scientist`.

## Myth 10. Data Science competitions are going to make you an Expert
- Data science competitions are a good idea to acquire the right skills and also to get an idea of the data science environment and even acquire development skills.
- But `if you think that by only participating in hackathons, and creating projects in competitions, you can help you become a data science expert then this is not true`. 
- `You will improve and add value to your resume, so that you can showcase your work and what kind of results you have achieved, but if you really want to be an expert you need to work on some realistic use cases or a production-level application`. For this reason, `it is advisable that freshmen are directed toward a good internship`.

# 10 Simple Things You Can Do to Improve Your Data Science Skills in 2023
(Here’s to making this next year productive, satisfying, and all-around beneficial)

## 1. Sign up for an online class
- `Data science is an ever-changing field`. As a result, you need to stay on top of your game.
- If you’re unwilling to keep up with and learn the latest technologies, you’ll be quickly left behind in `an industry that waits for no one`.
- So please, sign up for an online class, go through a detailed YouTube tutorial, learn a new technique on Kaggle, do SOMETHING.

## 2. Commit to learning one specific, new skill
- There are two advantages to expanding your skill set beyond your current comfort zone: <br/>
2.1.	You’ll become a `more diverse data scientist`. <br/>
2.2.	You’ll become a `more unique data scientist`. <br/>
- And `both of these advantages will lead to an even one: companies will want you`, and they’ll want you bad.

## 3. Teach someone, anyone, that machine learning isn’t magic
- A growing number of people have started to view machine learning as some kind of magical black box that can do anything.
- I don’t mean to burst your bubble, but machine learning is just a bunch of spreadsheets and complex mathematical equations. 
- It’s powerful, `but it’s only as good as the data`, and it can result in some pretty terrible results (think discriminatory facial recognition algorithms or self-driving cars that hit people) if your data isn’t up to par.

## 4. If you don’t know Pandas, learn it
- And if you do, learn something new about it.
- Pandas is one of the most powerful tools out there for data processing, manipulation, and analysis. It’s so well-established that more specialized modules are designed to work with its primary data storage method, the DataFrame: <br/>
4.1. Scikit-learn for machine learning <br/>
4.2. Altair for visualization <br/>
4.3. SciPy for scientific computing <br/>
- Developers and researchers are also consistently developing tools built on top of Pandas to make it even better. 

## 5. Learn a thing or two about qualitative research
- If you’re overly attached to your code and numbers (like myself), consider learning a thing or two about qualitative research.
- Good data science requires a bit of both.

## 6. Learn to design a user study
- `Blind trust in technology can be foolish and dangerous`. 
- As a result, good data science is becoming more human-centered.
- Whether you’re designing a new model, algorithm, or visualization, it is essential to test it to determine practical usability and ensure proper ethics. 
- However, running a proper, rigorous user study is no walk in the park. It involves careful design, a working knowledge of statistics, and the ability to put into practice what you learn.

## 7. `Work on a personal project
- Assuming you’re applying for an industry-based technical position, projects should be one of the most prominent sections on your resume.
- Employers aren’t nearly as concerned about where you’ve worked or what your degree is in as they are about what you can do. 
- Even when reading about your experience, all they’re really looking for are the details of your accomplishments at those respective jobs.
- Not only will building a personal project contribute to your resume — it’ll also help you hone your data science skills.
- It’s a win-win situation.`

## 8. Expand your view of data science
- Since I have a penchant toward the data science sub-field of visualization, I’ll `use it as an example here. Consider this example as a microcosm for all of data science`.
- When most folks hear the words “data visualization,” they think of line charts or bar graphs, perhaps even a histogram if they’re feeling adventurous.  
- This is an extremely limited view. `What’s the point of data visualization?` It’s meant to `take data that is in some hard-to-interpret form` — be it numerical, textual, or otherwise, `and represent it in a visual way that’s easy to understand`. It can be anything that takes such data and applies a visual transformation to it.
- Don’t get `hung up on textbook definitions of “data science”. Successful data science requires imagination and cleverness.  Broaden your perspective`.

## 9. Write an article
- `One of the best ways to learn something is to teach it`.
- Every time I write an article about some technical data science topic, I come out of it with a deeper understanding than I previously had. That’s simply the nature of writing. 
- `Being forced to articulate a concept clearly requires me to understand it deeply`. 
- On top of that, motivated by the fear of misleading others, I’ll often research the topic and review it with various resources first, adding even further to my own learning.
- Is it often time-consuming and intimidating? Yes. But is it well worth it? Most definitely.
- Give it a shot — you never know what you might learn.

## 10. And finally, take a break
- The tech industry is notorious for its intensity. 
- It’s easy to fall into a pattern which focuses on working and bettering yourself 24/7, all the while forgetting what life is truly about. 
- `You want to do data science to make the world a better place, right? Then start with yourself`. 
- `If you overwork yourself, you’ll become bitter — at everyone and everything. When that happens, it’ll be hard to remember why you started in the first place`.
- Trust me — I’ve been there. It’s a place better left unseen.
- So `be kind to yourself, take a breath, and maybe worry about that data set after a nice tropical vacation`.
