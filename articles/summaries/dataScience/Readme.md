# Understanding the Business: The Data Science Skill We Don’t Talk About Enough
(Why you need to master this skill, and how to go about it)
- In the real world, data science projects start from a a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve.
- The data scientist’s job is to `translate a business problem into the *right* data science problem`. Then solve it.
- To do this you must:
1.	Ask questions, list possible solutions.
2.	Explore the data to narrow down the list to one (for example: ML + A/B Test, etc.)

'There is nothing more frustrating than building a great data science solution, to the wrong business problem.'

# How to Set Yourself Up For Success As a New Data Science Consultant With No Experience

#### Why fight hoards of applicants when you can create your own job?
- This guide will help you get the ball rolling toward developing your own data science consulting job.
- Data scientists, even those who just graduated, have a unique skill set that can be used to help clients in a variety of scenarios
- The `trick is to have the right amount of patience, tenacity, and resilience` to set up your consulting business

## 1. How to pick your specialty
- Despite the general requirement for data scientists to be “jacks of all trades”, working as a consultant means that you’ll want to pick a specialty to avoid going crazy with stress.
- `The key is to know what you’re good at and focus on it`.
- Do some market research to see where your niche could lay 
- While they say that data scientists should all be generalists in the beginning, I believe that consultants should focus on specializing themselves in niches that complement their skills and their alternative knowledge.
- Companies love working with consultants who have first-hand experience in their sector, so it can’t hurt to play to your strengths, past employment, education, or interest background.

## 2. How to market your skills
- The most simple checklist possible to begin marketing your skills is to: (1) build a portfolio; (2) begin networking; and (3) attend industry events. 
- One of the best pieces of advice I was given for having success at networking or industry events is to have a QR code on your business card that can take people directly to your portfolio or website. This is a great way to speed the connection process and helps direct potential customers to what’s important right from the beginning.

## 3.How to find clients
- The first way to find clients is to do pro bono work for small businesses in your area to develop some projects and gain credibility.
- The next way to get clients is to become the go-to data science consultant for clients. 
- The final way to begin getting clients as a new data science consultant is to bid for micro-projects with companies who are outsourcing work.

## 4. How to price your services
- Don’t undersell yourself.
- How do you demonstrate your quality and ability by working for peanuts?
- Pricing can be tricky given that there are several different ways for you to bill your services, for example:
1. You could bill hourly, on a monthly retainer, through set product pricing, through value-based fees, or through a pay-for-results model. Hourly billing is self-explanatory, as is the monthly retainer model where you work for a flat fee each month. 
2. Alternatively, you could sell your services via a suite of products that you sell at a flat fee or with varying prices for different tiers of products (think interactive dashboards, reports, advanced levels of customization, etc). 
3. Value-based pricing is set through an agreement between you and your client where they decide how much to pay you based on the value of your work for the company. 
4. The final way you could price your services is through a pay-for-results model where you don’t get paid if your services don’t improve the client’s business.

- As an entry-level data science consultant, you could look at charging between $200–250 per hour and begin charging upwards of $300 per hour as you gain more experience. 
- This will vary depending on the industry that you provide your unique services to, with a likely ability to increase your rate for clients in the oil and gas sector and a likely requirement to decrease your rate for small businesses.

# Top 10 Data Science Myths Busted
(The data science field is full of job opportunities, yet there is still a lot of confusion about what data scientists actually do. This confusion is largely due to the many myths that exist about the role of a data scientist. In this article, we will bust the top 10 myths about data science. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the role…)

## Myth 1. All data roles are the same
- Data analysts, data engineers and data scientists are all doing the same thing, which is completely wrong because their jobs, roles and responsibilities are all very different. 
- Data engineers: Their responsibility is to work on the basic engineering stuff and build those scalable data pipelines so that raw data can be extracted from multiple sources, transformed, and dumped into downstream systems. 
- Data scientists and data analysts: Rely on this process because they transform data into something that matters — the process of transforming data into information. While these people should appear to be doing the same thing, their skills may overlap, but their duties are fundamentally distinct.

## Myth 2. Ph.D. or Master’s Degree is required to become a Data Scientist
- It also depends a lot on the type of job role you want to get. 
- If we are looking for a role in research, for example, we need a master’s or Ph.D., but if you want to solve complex data problems and work around deep learning or machine learning, then you will be the one to work on the data science stuff using the libraries and using the data analysis approaches in order to create those complex data mysteries. 
- You don’t need to hold a Master’s Degree. Nowadays everything is all about skills so if you have the right skill set for the data scientist then you can definitely get into it.

## Myth 3. Data Scientists need to be a pro coder
- As a data scientist your job is to work on data extensively and when we talk about pro coding it means working too much on the competitive programming side or having a very in-depth knowledge of typical data structures and algorithms. 
- Surely a data scientist must have good complex problem-solving skills and in the world of data science, we have languages like Python and R which provide very important support through multiple libraries that can be used to solve complex data problems. 
- Your goal as a data scientist should be to understand how to use those libraries and their modules so that you can create the best data models and models related to machine learning. 
- The data scientist `must have these skills in order not to waste too much time` on competitive programming or practicing typical data structures and algorithms.

## Myth 4. Data Science is only for CS (Computer Science) graduates
- This is one of the most important myths that must be debunked.
- Companies do not focus on the typical technical skills of a programmer, but they want to understand if the candidates are good in the aptitude part, if they are able to understand the case studies, if they are able to understand what kind of business matrices they can extract from the data and what kinds of complex data-related problems they can solve.

## Myth 5. Data Science is only about predictive modeling
- Not everyone knows that data scientists `invest 80% of their time in cleaning and transforming` data and 20% of their time is dedicated to the data modeling part, so a data scientist who wants to create very accurate data as well as a machine learning model, he needs to clean and transformed data. 
- We know that when we work on a particular Big Data solution, there are multiple steps involved in it and the first and `very important part is transforming the data`. 
- Nowadays, we receive data from multiple sources, and the raw data sometimes contains errors, as well as junk records. If we cannot clean our data, we will not be able to obtain meaningful transformation data, and we will not be able to create machine learning models that are very accurate. 
- That’s why data science is not just about building the predictive model and regression models, it’s a good mix of cleaning and transforming the data, and then building accurate machine learning models.

## Myth 6. Data Science requires a strong mathematical background
- This is also completely not true because being good at math is one of the important parts of your day-to-day activities as a data scientist. 
- While analyzing the data we would need those mathematical concepts, let’s say aggregating the data statistics part, probability part, but that is something which is and not a must to have a skill set to become a data scientist. 
- We have amazing programming languages like Python and R which provides great support for amazing libraries as well which we can directly use in order to perform that typical mathematical calculation and computation so unless you need to innovate something, or you need to create any new algorithm you don’t need to be a mathematics expert.

## Myth 7. Learning a tool is enough to become a Data Scientist
- A good data science profile is a `combination of multiple skills, technical skills plus non-technical skills`. 
- Both are required to become good data scientists. In order to become a good data scientist, you cannot just rely on programming or any specific tool you think is being used in data science. If you are a good expert in both stuff, you are likely to become a good data scientist. 
- As data scientists, `we have to interact with multiple stakeholders when working on complex data problems`, and we must work directly with the business to gather all the requirements. 
- `Understanding the data domain, why we are processing it, what insights we can gain from the transform data, how to solve it, and what is relevant and what is irrelevant, are all necessary for this data science domain. Don’t think that only technical stuff or any specific tool like a language or a database is just enough to crack the data science profile. You need to use your non-technical skills and soft skills as your support system to become a good data scientist`.
