# How to Get Your Resume Noticed (And Out of the Trash Bin)

#### 1. Outsmart the robots
- It’s important for job seekers to use keywords that are also found in the actual job description
- When you apply for any job, you should pay attention to what the company has written about it
- The language they use has been intentionally crafted to highlight the skills and experiences they seek, so weave that language into your CV

#### 2. Show Off Your Skills
- Underneath your name and title, include a summary about what you have to offer and who you are as a professional.
- As well as a key skills section highlighting your strengths — focusing on the ones that are most relevant to the job.

#### 3. Don’t Restrict Work Experience to “Work”
- Recently out of college with little work experience? Consider including major projects and papers you worked on as a student

#### 4. Let the Numbers Do the Talking
- It shows the depth of their success by citing cold, hard facts
- Metrics are essential to telling the story of previous successes. 
- So keep track of any quantifiable milestones you’re hitting in your current role, project, or internship
