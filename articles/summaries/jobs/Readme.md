# How to Use Your LinkedIn Profile to Power a Career Transition
- It’s tempting to create an “everything under the sink” profile that makes you look qualified for both the job you have and the one you want or for a variety of new functions, industries, or roles. But that’ll just confuse your readers and send them running—to others’ LinkedIn pages.
- Instead, focus your profile on your new career direction, just as you’ve tailored your resume to specific jobs. In both cases, you highlight your most relevant experiences and minimize or omit the rest.
- Here’s how to do that on LinkedIn:
1. HEADLINE: Focus first on your headline (if you write an irresistible headline, I’ll take the time to click to your entire profile).  Check to see how distinctive your headline is by searching LinkedIn for people like you.
2. SUMMARY: Tell a compelling story and write it in the first person.  
- LinkedIn summary gives you much more space (up to 2000 characters) to highlight past accomplishments and connect them to what you want to do next.
- Craft a cohesive narrative that pulls together what might otherwise appear to be fragmented pieces of your professional past. 
- This will avoid leaving your profile reader wondering what the heck you’re trying to do now—or why you appear scattered and unfocused.
3. EXPERIENCE: Tailor each of the positions in your experience section.
- Continue to write in the first person—to provide continuity with your first-person summary.
- Focus on accomplishments, not responsibilities. But highlight only the accomplishments most relevant to the new type of work you’re seeking. Make those accomplishments concrete by noting the problem you solved, how, and the specific results you generated.
4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sparingly add recommendations to selected positions — the ones most relevant to the new type of work you’re seeking. 
- Invite one or two people to recommend you.
- Tell them exactly the type of positions you’re now targeting and the skills you’d like them to highlight.
6. IMAGES AND MEDIA SHAPES:
- Use images and media samples to draw attention to your most impressive accomplishments. 
- Add them only to the positions you want your new profile readers to focus on.

- I want to see that they are intelligent and able to communicate effectively.
- The candidate must have a good understanding of data science concepts.

### 1. Understanding of data science concepts: Do you have a good grasp of the basic concepts, such as hypothesis testing and machine learning?
Is important for a data scientist to have a strong understanding of data science concepts.
- How would you explain hypothesis testing to someone with no prior knowledge? 
- What are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms
- Why do you think that is?

### 2. Communication skills: Can you explain your thought process and results effectively?
- One of the most important communication skills during a job interview is effectively explaining your thought process and results.
- To effectively communicate your thought process and results, you need to be able to break down complex concepts into simple terms.

### 3. Motivation: Are you excited about working on data science projects in my organization?
- I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to work on data science projects that can have a real impact.

### 4. Independence: Are you able to work independently with little supervision?
- Being able to work independently is an important skill for any data scientist, regardless of their level of experience. 
- During a job interview, a potential employer may ask if you are able to work independently with little supervision.
- The best way to answer this question is to provide a specific example of a time when you were able to work independently successfully.
- By giving a concrete example, you can show that you have the independent problem-solving skills the employer is looking for.
- An important part of working independently is being able to manage your own time effectively. 

### 5. Attitude: do you have the right attitude?
- Employers place a great deal of emphasis on attitude during job interviews.
- If you’re interviewing for a junior data scientist role, here are a few tips to ensure you have the right attitude:
- First, be humble. It’s important to be confident in your abilities, but you don’t want to come across as arrogant. Remember, you’re applying for a junior role. 
- Second, be positive. A positive attitude is infectious and can go a long way in making a good impression during an interview. Be sure to smile and exude confidence, even if you’re feeling nervous on the inside.
- Finally, be prepared to answer questions about your attitude.

While technical skills are important, soft skills are just as critical for data scientists. In order to be successful in the data science marketplace, you have to stand out from the rest by demonstrating that you can communicate effectively with other team members, work independently, and be motivated to learn new things.
