# How to Get Your Resume Noticed (And Out of the Trash Bin)

#### 1. Outsmart the robots
- It’s important for job seekers to use keywords that are also found in the actual job description
- When you apply for any job, you should pay attention to what the company has written about it
- The language they use has been intentionally crafted to highlight the skills and experiences they seek, so weave that language into your CV

#### 2. Show Off Your Skills
- Underneath your name and title, include a summary about what you have to offer and who you are as a professional.
- As well as a key skills section highlighting your strengths — focusing on the ones that are most relevant to the job.

#### 3. Don’t Restrict Work Experience to “Work”
- Recently out of college with little work experience? Consider including major projects and papers you worked on as a student

#### 4. Let the Numbers Do the Talking
- It shows the depth of their success by citing cold, hard facts
- Metrics are essential to telling the story of previous successes. 
- So keep track of any quantifiable milestones you’re hitting in your current role, project, or internship

# 5 Reasons Why Every Data Scientist Should Consider Freelancing

#### 1.Work on New Problems
- This gives data scientists a unique opportunity to apply their expertise to a wide range of fields and industries
- It’s easy for data scientists to operate in a narrow set of contexts, which can be problematic if your goal is to learn and improve

#### 2. Improve Communication via Marketing, Interviewing, Negotiation, etc.
- You need to connect and communicate with people who don’t know anything about what you know or how you can solve their problems. 
- You need to sell yourself and your ideas, which is a good skill set to have no matter where you end up in life.

#### 3. Fine-tune Pitches Through Iterations
- If you’re trying to improve your resume, craft compelling proposals, or present yourself effectively, you need reps and feedback

#### 4. Flexibility & Autonomy
- Contracts often don’t restrict when or where work needs to be done, it just needs to get done by the deadline.
- When we can choose what we work on, when we work on it, and who we work with, the work we do is more engaging.

#### 5. Build Relationships & New Connections
- Through my contract work, I have had the opportunity to meet fascinating people who work in worlds I didn’t even know existed.
- I’ve worked with ER doctors, special forces operators, clinicians, business people, and researchers with so many different backgrounds and experiences.
- These connections have truly enriched how I see the world.

# How to Use Your LinkedIn Profile to Power a Career Transition
- It’s tempting to create an “everything under the sink” profile that makes you look qualified for both the job you have and the one you want or for a variety of new functions, industries, or roles. But that’ll just confuse your readers and send them running—to others’ LinkedIn pages.
- Instead, focus your profile on your new career direction, just as you’ve tailored your resume to specific jobs. In both cases, you highlight your most relevant experiences and minimize or omit the rest.
- Here’s how to do that on LinkedIn:
1. HEADLINE: Focus first on your headline (if you write an irresistible headline, I’ll take the time to click to your entire profile).  Check to see how distinctive your headline is by searching LinkedIn for people like you.
2. SUMMARY: Tell a compelling story and write it in the first person.  
- LinkedIn summary gives you much more space (up to 2000 characters) to highlight past accomplishments and connect them to what you want to do next.
- Craft a cohesive narrative that pulls together what might otherwise appear to be fragmented pieces of your professional past. 
- This will avoid leaving your profile reader wondering what the heck you’re trying to do now—or why you appear scattered and unfocused.
3. EXPERIENCE: Tailor each of the positions in your experience section.
- Continue to write in the first person—to provide continuity with your first-person summary.
- Focus on accomplishments, not responsibilities. But highlight only the accomplishments most relevant to the new type of work you’re seeking. Make those accomplishments concrete by noting the problem you solved, how, and the specific results you generated.
4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sparingly add recommendations to selected positions — the ones most relevant to the new type of work you’re seeking. 
- Invite one or two people to recommend you.
- Tell them exactly the type of positions you’re now targeting and the skills you’d like them to highlight.
6. IMAGES AND MEDIA SHAPES:
- Use images and media samples to draw attention to your most impressive accomplishments. 
- Add them only to the positions you want your new profile readers to focus on.

# From a Hiring Manager’s Perspective: What I Was Looking for in a Junior Data Scientist Role During the Interview
- I want to see that they are intelligent and able to communicate effectively.
- The candidate must have a good understanding of data science concepts.
- Look for signs that the candidate is motivated and can work independently.

### 1. Understanding of data science concepts: Do you have a good grasp of the basic concepts, such as hypothesis testing and machine learning?
Is important for a data scientist to have a strong understanding of data science concepts.
- How would you explain hypothesis testing to someone with no prior knowledge? 
- What are some of the most popular machine learning algorithms
- Why do you think that is?

### 2. Communication skills: Can you explain your thought process and results effectively?
- One of the most important communication skills during a job interview is effectively explaining your thought process and results.
- To effectively communicate your thought process and results, you need to be able to break down complex concepts into simple terms. 
- Practice providing an example where you had to explain a complex concept or result to a non-data-savvy audience. The key word here is “practice.”

### 3. Motivation: Are you excited about working on data science projects in my organization?
- I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to work on data science projects that can have a real impact.

### 4. Independence: Are you able to work independently with little supervision?
- Being able to work independently is an important skill for any data scientist, regardless of their level of experience. 
- During a job interview, a potential employer may ask if you are able to work independently with little supervision.
- The best way to answer this question is to provide a specific example of a time when you were able to work independently successfully.
- By giving a concrete example, you can show that you have the independent problem-solving skills the employer is looking for.
- An important part of working independently is being able to manage your own time effectively. 

### 5. Attitude: do you have the right attitude?
- Employers place a great deal of emphasis on attitude during job interviews.
- If you’re interviewing for a junior data scientist role, here are a few tips to ensure you have the right attitude:
- First, be humble. It’s important to be confident in your abilities, but you don’t want to come across as arrogant. Remember, you’re applying for a junior role. 
- Second, be positive. A positive attitude is infectious and can go a long way in making a good impression during an interview. Be sure to smile and exude confidence, even if you’re feeling nervous on the inside.
- Finally, be prepared to answer questions about your attitude.

While technical skills are important, soft skills are just as critical for data scientists. In order to be successful in the data science marketplace, you have to stand out from the rest by demonstrating that you can communicate effectively with other team members, work independently, and be motivated to learn new things.

# Prepare Your CV for a Data Science Job

### In my first access
1. Design and concise CVs are really important. I don’t have time to read 5 pages curriculum nor a CV that is not well structured.
2. The data science skills and tools used must be at glance and easily captured.
3. Some CVs have a lot of experience that is not relevant to the job applied, as example, asking for NLP experience or Deep Learning and not showed even once in the experiences or keywords.
4. A common filter should be applied. I have to apply a common minimum threshold to all candidates to filter them out.
5. I can’t read fully all the CVs. The long CVs will be directly removed unless they have a summary at the beginning, that engages me with relevant information.

### After checking a few curricula I could classify the applications into:
-	Good. Less than 2 pages and everything I want to check on the first page. Preferable just 1 page. Easy to understand the ML skills with categories and level of experience.
-	Long but well-structured. The CV is long, but still, it’s easy to read and includes a summary on the first page. Probably the person can’t summarize so good and wants to add everything in case it helps to get the job, or he/she has too much experience and projects.
-	Long and impossible to follow. I noticed the same type of 5 page plus CVs for multiple applicants. They are long, with no margin, categories or structure to understand what you are reading.

### Tips for mastering your Resume
- Work experience should be the first thing the hiring manager sees. I’m mainly interested in your relevant experience, please don’t add a list of your skills before this. Ideally, you add your work experience (including the years and accomplishments) and the skills and/or tools needed for that job or developed during that time.
-	If the job you are applying to is heavily focused on python, classification algorithms, and NLP, add keywords under your work experience: it will show your relevant experience for the job and catch the eye of the recruiter faster.
-	If you don’t have enough work experience, add your experience on projects such as Kaggle or any other project with real data.
-	If you come from a research university, adapt the skills and tools to the job you are applying to. If the job description asks for knowledge of python, don’t say you know Stata and Latex; that’s not going to be useful and it just takes space in your resume.
-	Don’t add a long list of skills without categorization. If your skills are based on programming, ML frameworks, algorithms, soft skills, version control tools, languages, etc. then say it, don’t add them all waiting for the hiring manager to find the one they are interested in. Extra tip: if the position asks for X, Y or Z skills, make use of BOLD to highlight you already have that. It will catch recruiter’s eyes faster.
-	Don’t add extra things just to fill up space. Make sure you are concise and that you don’t repeat always the same descriptions in job experience. If for 2 jobs in your life you have been doing A/B testing, add that one in one of them and in the other add that you analyze the data or anything else you have done related to the A/B test. It will show variety and I will see that you already know that. Then in the interview, you will be able to really show that you master that skill.
-	Make sure the position of the title in the work experience section is aligned with the Company and the time worked there. Apply proper margins. In the end, we are humans, we read organized things, not messy. If your CV is not organized, I would assume that you won’t be organized in your position, so unless the hiring manager relates to that, you won’t be easily taken into account.
-	Don’t write that you are single or even your birth date. We base the decisions on your qualifications, so avoid anything extra that could bias the decision.
-	Send your CV in PDF, not .docx. You don’t know the platform we are using to open it, and if it’s not pdf it’s possible we don’t see it as beautiful as you did it.

------------------------------------------

# Top Mistakes to Avoid in Your 2022 Data Science Job Search
Three of the most common mistakes made during data science job searches include:
-	Applying to different types of positions simultaneously
-	Not preparing for interviews
-	Suffering from analysis paralysis

### Mistake 1: Applying to Multiple Position Types at the Same Time
You might think that applying to multiple position types at the same time is a good way to turn the odds in your favor. However, in reality, this is a bad idea.
- It’s inefficient, an incredible waste of time.  For the best results, you should instead focus on applying to one type of position and become an expert at it.
- Your skills won’t be as sharp. If you never focus on a single role, you’ll have a hard time garnering the required skills to land a job as a data scientist.  By focusing on one type of data science role, you’ll be able to study more in-depth and quickly gain the skills that employers are looking for.
- You waste time applying. You might not realize it at first, but each application will require tailoring your resume and cover letter for the job, and the time spent making those changes can quickly add up!
- With so much to study, if you are applying for multiple different types of positions, you’ll quickly find that the interview process becomes overwhelming. You’ll be stressed, and you won’t be able to adequately prepare and will likely flunk your interviews.
- Focusing on one position type with laser precision can help your data science job search.  It’s far better to hone your skills in a niche rather than trying to hit everything you possibly can. 

### Mistake 2: Going into an Interview Unprepared
- Going into an interview without adequately preparing for it. Some will head into interviews without even knowing what type of questions are likely to be asked.  When practicing for a coding interview, be sure to verbalize your thought process so that you can get a feel for the timing of an actual interview.
- Not Knowing Your Interviewer.  You should never walk into an interview blind.  Presentation interviews can be tricky to prepare for. Once a company asked me to present my most impactful project.  I assumed my audience would be data scientists, so I introduced lots of technical terms.  But it turned out this was a big mistake. The audience was a mix of stakeholders, in this case data science managers and product managers.  This is why it always pays to research your interviewer. A simple pre-interview email can often help reveal an interviewer’s position within a company.  Either way the point is that you need to do some work before you even walk into the interview.
- Unfamiliar with the Product.  Some’ve failed interviews because they weren’t familiar with the company’s products at all.  

#### People land jobs faster when they are well prepared or even over-prepared for interviews.

### Mistake 3: Paralysis by Analysis
- As a data scientist you can’t always analyze everything to death.
- The mistake I want to point out is worrying about whether learning something would be helpful before taking actions to learn.
- You only know if something is helpful after you learn it. Other people’s experience might not apply to you. <br/>
a. Don’t spend too much time worrying about what you don’t know, instead spend time gaining new skills. <br/>
b. Steady improvement will lead to a solid foundation for your abilities as a data scientist and lead to more successful outcomes from interviews. 
- If you realize you have a knowledge gap, and you know there’s a way to help you gain the knowledge and fill the gap, then simply take action rather than wasting time over-analyzing. Remember that you’ll never regret any investment in yourself.

---------------------------------

# 5 Things in Your Resume That Are Keeping You from Getting Your First Job in Data Science

### 1. Skill-level bars to indicate skill proficiency
- Instead of skill-level bars, discuss the skills you used in your description of previous employment and projects to demonstrate how long you’ve been using the skill, what you’ve used the skill for, and what impact you’ve made by using the skill.

### 2. Lack of personal projects that demonstrate real-world problem solving
- One of the most common complaints of tech recruiters is that candidates lack real-world problem-solving skills.
- The key here is to remember the old saying, “show, don’t tell.”
- While it’s easy to tell an employer that you’ve solved many real-world problems through your independent research projects, it’s much more impactful if you show them the problem you solved and exactly how you solved it.
- A personal portfolio linked to your resume will help you out here. In that portfolio, you want to develop several projects that figure out specific problems within your target industry.

### 3. The wrong set of programming skills for the job
- Listing 20 programming languages or skills is useless to an employer who only wants to know if you can work with Python, Excel, and SQL. Additionally, this shows a lack of preparation on the job seeker’s part because it presents a resume designed to be a “one-size-fits-all” solution to the job application process.
- Remember, more isn’t always better. A recruiter would rather see concrete evidence of experience with the programming languages and skills their company is looking for than random experience in 20 different languages.
- Prepare a tailored resume for each job application by carefully scanning the job ad and highlighting the exact languages and skills they are looking for. Then, make it easy for the recruiter by giving concrete examples of your ability with that language or skill, and link to projects that demonstrate your abilities (again, “show, don’t tell”).
- In short, the focus should be on making it easy for a recruiter to visualize you successfully becoming a valuable member of the team.

### 4. A focus on algorithms and code and not outcomes
- The value of data scientists is their impact on a company and the outcomes their work produces.
- If your resume focuses more on the fancy algorithm you used to solve a problem instead of the outcome of solving that problem, a recruiter may not be convinced of the impact your analysis had.
- Instead of focusing the entirety of your project description on the algorithms you used or the code you wrote, add sentences where you describe the impact your analysis had or the outcome of your project.
- This description should include quantifiable information, such as percentages, growth indexes, and monetary values.

### 5. No indication of lifelong learning
- Make a point of working on personal research projects every so often to show recruiters that you are always looking to improve your skills and learn something new.
- Each new project doesn’t have to be huge, but it should integrate some new technology, algorithm, or thought process to tackle a real-world problem. Each project should be described in your resume using a short sentence that captures the advancement of your skillset and the problem you set out to solve.
- Adding links to your project repository or portfolio is a great way to give recruiters a hands-on look at your work.

# Building a Data Science Team

### 1. How to start building a data science team

#### Defining a project and then starting recruiting
- Start with the following questions: What problems are you trying to solve? What kind of data do you need to build your project? Answering these questions will help you determine the skillsets and expertise you need on your team. Once you have an idea of the team you need, it’s time to start recruiting.
#### Starting immediately hiring and then defining a project

Although you could have in your mind your final goal, you may not know which features will lead to the final product. For this reason, you could start hiring different roles that would take you to that point to get a better understanding of your vision.

`The best way to find talented data scientists is through referrals from people you trust. Attend meetups and conferences related to data science and big data, and post job listings on relevant online communities and forums.`

- Once you have a few candidates, it’s important to evaluate their skillset carefully. 
- In addition to technical ability, you want to make sure they have strong communication skills and are able to work well in a team environment. 
- The best way to assess these skills is through coding challenges and interviews that test both their technical abilities and soft skills.

### 2. Specialists vs generalists

####	Generalists
- Professionals who have a general knowledge of all the Data Science workflow
- From project setup to project deployment, but they do not have specific knowledge of the single steps of the Data Science workflow.
#### Specialists
- Professionals who have specific knowledge of a single step of the Data Science workflow
- But do not know the general Data Science workflow.

If you decide to hire specialists, you’ll need to make sure that each team member is able to work together and share their knowledge. This can be a challenge, but if you have the right mix of people it can lead to a very strong team. The advantage of this approach is that each team member will be an expert in their own area and they’ll be able to bring a lot of knowledge to the table. </br>

If you decide to go with a team of generalists, the advantage of this approach is that everyone will have a good understanding of the whole data science process. </br>

In a startup, you should hire first generalists — people who can do pretty much everything. In fact, when you start, you have no lines of code. There’s nothing, which means you need to do back end, front end, DevOps, and whatever.
Instead, if your company is already stable, probably you need more specialists, who focus on specific problems, such as tuning hyperparameters of a Machine Learning model. </br>

As your company grows, you may begin hiring more and more specialists and fewer generalists.

### 3. Who to hire first

The answer, of course, depends on your specific needs. </br>
But in general, we recommend hiring first the following three profiles:

1. Machine Learning engineers or Software engineers with Machine Learning skills.
2. Data engineers, that build and maintain the systems that collect and store all that data.
3. Product managers, that prioritize the work to do.

At the beginning, you need people who can work on the prototype, who will write a lot of coding, and who will work on the product. It doesn’t make sense for you to hire a UX/UI designer when you have no work for them.  </br>
Of course, every team is different, and you may find that you need to hire a different combination of roles depending on your unique circumstances. So you really need to understand, at which stage you are. And what kind of roles do you need now to solve this problem.

### 4. What is a strong product team

A product team is responsible for the development and management of a company’s products. This includes everything from the initial idea and conception of the product, to its design, production, and eventual distribution.

A strong product team is a team that is building a product that the customer wants. Strong means:
- very customer-centric
- delivering features very fast
- testing these things out with customers very fast.

A strong product team will have a clear understanding of the market they are targeting and will work together to ensure that the final product meets the needs of their target audience. In order to build a strong product team, it is important to have a clear vision for the product and to assemble a team of individuals with the skills and experience necessary to bring that vision to fruition.

### 5. Motivating team to write articles and contribute to open source

Data science is a collaborative field, and one of the best ways to learn and improve your skills is to share your knowledge with others. Writing blog posts and articles is a great way to do this, and it can also be a good motivator for your team. </br>
You should encourage your team members to write articles about their work and provide them with any resources they need to get started. You can also offer incentives for writing articles, such as bonus points or rewards. </br>
Contributing to open-source projects is another great way for your team to learn and improve their skills. You could even encourage your team members to find projects they’re interested in and contribute their time and expertise. Again, you can offer incentives for open source contributions, such as bonus points or rewards.  </br>

### 6. Hiring a data scientist

#### First...
- it’s important to find someone with the right skillset. 
- You can look at the candidate curriculum. 
- A data scientist should be able to not only analyze data, but also understand how to use that data to solve real-world problems.
- Additionally, they should be well-versed in statistics and modeling, 
- And be able to communicate their findings effectively.

#### Then...
- Once you’ve found a few candidates with the right skillset, 
- it’s important to interview them thoroughly. 
- In addition to questions about their experience and qualifications, be sure to ask them about their approach to data science and how they would go about solving a specific problem. 
- This will help you get a better sense of their thought process and whether or not they would be a good fit for your team.

#### And then...
- The interview should also include questions on personal experiences, to check whether that person is interesting or not. 
- If someone is just plain boring, this is very difficult for the team. 
- That person also needs a hobby, such as going to the cinema, doing some sports, or whatever. 
- But that person needs to do something. 
- You work more time with that person than you spend with your girlfriend or your wife. 
- You spend more time with them than with the person that you love. 
- So that’s why you need to understand that person really well.

#### Finally:
- You could also include a second interview, which could be a homework assignment. 
- You could send out some homework, which is not very difficult. 
- Then the candidate sends you the code, whether it is Jupyter Notebook or whatever. 
- Then you should check it. From this simple task, you could already see how much people are working.

### 7. Pickingthe next projects to work on
There are a lot of data science projects out there, and it can be tough to decide which ones to tackle next. Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing projects:
- Consider the impact of the project. Will it make a big difference for your company or customers?
- Think about the difficulty of the project. Is it something you and your team are confident you can handle?
- Take into account the resources you have available. Do you have the time and budget to dedicate to this project?
- Lastly, don’t forget to have some fun! Data science is supposed to be enjoyable, so pick projects that seem interesting and exciting to you and your team.

-----------------------------

# 3 Underappreciated Skills to Make You A Next-Level Data Scientist

- In the job market, you expand your chances of getting hired if you have a skill an employer is in desperate need of. Oftentimes, the necessary skill might be a bit unorthodox, but that’s exactly what makes it in demand. Standard members of the field haven’t mastered it — and thus it is coveted.
- Most people who come into data science roles tend to display the same standard set of skills: data management, proficiency in statistics and probability, user testing, basic data analysis, and foundations of machine learning, among others.
- While these skills are undeniably important, you become increasingly attractive to an employer if you combine them with other, less common skills that are nevertheless beneficial to the data science workflow.

### 1. Visualization
- “visual representations can communicate information more rapidly and effectively than text” 
- People like simple things and pretty things. Lucky for them, visualizations — if done well — have the potential to simplify data into pretty summaries. If you can master the skill of designing and implementing, you’ll attract attention in a data science setting, no doubt.

There are two parts to this: 1) understanding what goes into good visualizations and 2) actually implementing these visualizations. </br>

1. Don’t try to show everything: There is no such thing as a perfect, all-encompassing visualization for a data set. Pick 1–2 aspects of the data to highlight, and design a visualization based on that. </br>
2. Keep it simple: Don’t overdo it — your job is to simplify the data, not make it even more complicated.  </br>
3. Choose wise representations: For example, don’t use a discrete set of random colors to represent a continuous quantitative value like percentage score on an exam. Choose visual representations that are easy for the viewer to interpret.  </br>
4. Don’t lie about the data: If I need to convince you on this one, it’s probably best that you stay away from data science in general.  </br>

If you do choose to learn this skill, there is a long path ahead. But in return, the rewards you will reap in the pursuit of data science excellence will also be immense.

### 2. Not being afraid to go back to the data

- No matter what you’re doing — building a model, designing a visualization, or setting up a database — the quality of your data matters.
- This seems like a simple enough statement, especially when you consider the name “data science.” But it’s a surprisingly easy fact to overlook when you’re in the thralls of an involved, important project which has been in the works for many months (or even years). It’s hard to acknowledge that you have to start over. Simply doing so is a skill in itself — an underrated and valuable one.
- The solution is not always in “improving the model,” whatever that means. Sometimes, no amount of fancy Python modules or incoherent statistical maneuvering will get you the result you need, and you will need to accept that perhaps your data is insufficient or inaccurate.
- No one likes hacky solutions. Go back and fix the data when necessary.

### 3. Unorthodox Forms of Data
There are plenty of data formats which far fewer people know how to work with — if you make one of them your specialty, you could become a hot commodity on the job market. Here is a (very incomplete) list of examples:
- Text Data:
- Image Data:
- Geo-spatial data:

Most everything in the world can be viewed as data, and thus embodies a potential avenue for the field of data science to explore. It’s therefore unfortunate that we often neglect potentially exciting areas of study in favor of the comfort provided by rows and columns of numbers.  </br>

It’s a simple case of supply and demand. Not enough people know how to deal with the immense supply of unorthodox data — become one of them, and you’ll be in high demand.

# What I Look For in Every Data Analyst Candidate
(From the Perspective of a Hiring Manager)

## 1. Focus Your Technical Skillset
- Many who are new to the data analysis workforce, tend to present a laundry list of technical skills that they have fair to rudimentary knowledge of in the hopes that it might give them an edge. `This is a mistake`.
- What matters is that you can demonstrate the ability to use the skills you have learned in a real-world application. 
- For example, if you have spent your time learning how to program in R (the statistical language):
1. I would want to hear about how you deployed it to answer real-world questions versus just being able to recite a list of functions you could call. 
2. Describe the question you were seeking to answer from a business perspective and then what functionalities of the tool you used to answer it. 
- Being able to do this will demonstrate two things to me. First, that you possess the technical skill and second (and much more importantly), that you understand how to use it within the context of a business.
