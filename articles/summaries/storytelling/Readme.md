# 8 Tips for Creating a Compelling Presentation for Data Science
(Tricks every analyst and data scientist can learn to make a compelling presentation)
## 1.	Start With an Outline
But don’t think of this as an [outline](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-create-presentation-outline) of the slides you want to create. `Think of the outline as the story you’re going to tell.`
## 2.	Storytelling with Situation, Complication, Resolution
It’s a simple framework that keeps you organized in your structure, brings action-oriented results.
-	Situation: Facts about the current state.
-	Complication: Action is required based on the situation.
-	Resolution: The action is taken or recommended to solve the complication.

## 3.	The One Minute Per Slide Rule
Instead of creating your presentation and rehearsing the timing, consider that each major content slide will take one minute to present.
Eliminate the stress from figuring out how much content you need to create.
## 4.	The Rule of Three
Stick with three and only three items when building your structure, sections of your story, or the number of bullet points on your slide.
Will help your audience remember your content and simplify building the presentation.
## 5.	Write Slide Titles as Outcomes
With this simple practice you can dramatically improve your presentation with little effort.
## 6.	Reading Titles Outloud
- By reading just the tile and title only as you start each slide, the audience will be able to process the message much more easily than reading the written words and listening to you simultaneously. 
- For the rest of the slide, do not read the content, especially if you use a lot of bulleted or ordered lists. Reading all of your content can be monotonous, as mentioned above.
## 7.	Focus Your Audience’s Attention
When your eyes and brain first see a slide, for the first fraction of a second, you are drawn to different elements that stand out. Items can be in bold, italics, or a different color or size. The fact that they are different from the main text is how you can focus your attention.
