# 8 Tips for Creating a Compelling Presentation for Data Science
(Tricks every analyst and data scientist can learn to make a compelling presentation)
## 1.	Start With an Outline
But don’t think of this as an [outline](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-create-presentation-outline) of the slides you want to create. `Think of the outline as the story you’re going to tell.`
## 2.	Storytelling with Situation, Complication, Resolution
It’s a simple framework that keeps you organized in your structure, brings action-oriented results.
-	Situation (setup): Facts about the current state.
-	Complication (conflict): Action is required based on the situation.
-	Resolution: The action is taken or recommended to solve the complication.

## 3.	The One Minute Per Slide Rule
Instead of creating your presentation and rehearsing the timing, consider that each major content slide will take one minute to present.
Eliminate the stress from figuring out how much content you need to create.
## 4.	The Rule of Three
Stick with three and only three items when building your structure, sections of your story, or the number of bullet points on your slide.
Will help your audience remember your content and simplify building the presentation.

## 5.	Write Slide Titles as Outcomes
With this simple practice you can dramatically improve your presentation with little effort.
## 6.	Reading Titles Outloud
- By reading just the tile and title only as you start each slide, the audience will be able to process the message much more easily than reading the written words and listening to you simultaneously. 
- For the rest of the slide, do not read the content, especially if you use a lot of bulleted or ordered lists. Reading all of your content can be monotonous.
## 7.	Focus Your Audience’s Attention
When your eyes and brain first see a slide, for the first fraction of a second, you are drawn to different elements that stand out. Items can be in bold, italics, or a different color or size. The fact that they are different from the main text is how you can focus your attention.

For example: In which graph is the number of 7 best counted?

# Is Public Speaking the Kryptonite of Data Scientists?
(The three key lessons that helped me improve my presentation skills)

## 1. Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away
- The business stakeholders will not perceive a less detailed presentation as unprofessional or sub-par. 
- In fact, the exact opposite occurs in reality. The more targeted and simplistic your presentations are, the easier they will be to follow and understand, compared to a more heavy presentation that will make your audience tune out after a couple of minutes.
- Before you start creating your presentation, there are three key aspects to focus on that can help you separate the noise from the signal in your decks:
1. Who is your audience, and what is their technical proficiency? 
2. Why should that audience care about the topic you are presenting? 
3. What will you present?

## 2. Your visuals should be assets and not liabilities
There are two main building blocks within each slide, the actual visual (table or chart) and a short summary of the insights found in it.

### Tables
- Using a table in a live presentation is usually a bad idea as it interacts with our verbal system, meaning we have to read them to understand them. 
- This is not ideal, as during your presentation you want your audience to be focused on what you are saying rather than trying to interpret the table. 
- In most cases, you will be better off visualizing your data or keeping the core numbers in your slide and adding the full table in the appendix. 
- If you decide to use tables, remember that you want the design to fade into the background, letting the pearl(s) take center stage.

</p>

### Charts
- A chart will get the point across much quicker and easier than a table. 
- However, they can also be disastrous if overcomplicated. 
- The only purpose of your chart should be to help the audience understand the insight you want to convey. 
- Suppose, on the other hand, the chart is complicated and requires more effort to understand. In that case, the most likely outcome is that your audience will decide that they don’t want to devote any more time to it and mentally check out (and understandably so).

</p>

### Summary
- The summary is usually located at the top of your slide. 
- This should be self-explanatory, so the audience understands the insights and how they contribute to your presentation’s primary objective.

## 3. Fake it until you make it
`The only way to improve is by practicing.`
- You should start with small presentations to make yourself feel more confident and gradually move to bigger audiences. 
- You should also not be afraid to ask for help from others.
