# Understanding the Business: The Data Science Skill We Don’t Talk About Enough
(Why you need to master this skill, and how to go about it)
- In the real world, data science projects start from a a business problem you need to understand, frame, and solve.
- The data scientist’s job is to `translate a business problem into the *right* data science problem`. Then solve it.
- To do this you must:
1.	Ask questions, list possible solutions.
2.	Explore the data to narrow down the list to one (for example: ML + A/B Test, etc.)

'There is nothing more frustrating than building a great data science solution, to the wrong business problem.'

# How to Set Yourself Up For Success As a New Data Science Consultant With No Experience

#### Why fight hoards of applicants when you can create your own job?
- This guide will help you get the ball rolling toward developing your own data science consulting job.
- Data scientists, even those who just graduated, have a unique skill set that can be used to help clients in a variety of scenarios
- The `trick is to have the right amount of patience, tenacity, and resilience` to set up your consulting business

## 1. How to pick your specialty
- Despite the general requirement for data scientists to be “jacks of all trades”, working as a consultant means that you’ll want to pick a specialty to avoid going crazy with stress.
- `The key is to know what you’re good at and focus on it`.
- Do some market research to see where your niche could lay 
- While they say that data scientists should all be generalists in the beginning, I believe that consultants should focus on specializing themselves in niches that complement their skills and their alternative knowledge.
- Companies love working with consultants who have first-hand experience in their sector, so it can’t hurt to play to your strengths, past employment, education, or interest background.

## 2. How to market your skills
- The most simple checklist possible to begin marketing your skills is to: (1) build a portfolio; (2) begin networking; and (3) attend industry events. 
- One of the best pieces of advice I was given for having success at networking or industry events is to have a QR code on your business card that can take people directly to your portfolio or website. This is a great way to speed the connection process and helps direct potential customers to what’s important right from the beginning.

## 3.How to find clients
- The first way to find clients is to do pro bono work for small businesses in your area to develop some projects and gain credibility.
- The next way to get clients is to become the go-to data science consultant for clients. 
- The final way to begin getting clients as a new data science consultant is to bid for micro-projects with companies who are outsourcing work.

## 4. How to price your services
- Don’t undersell yourself.
- How do you demonstrate your quality and ability by working for peanuts?
- Pricing can be tricky given that there are several different ways for you to bill your services.
- For example:
1. You could bill hourly, on a monthly retainer, through set product pricing, through value-based fees, or through a pay-for-results model. Hourly billing is self-explanatory, as is the monthly retainer model where you work for a flat fee each month. 
2. Alternatively, you could sell your services via a suite of products that you sell at a flat fee or with varying prices for different tiers of products (think interactive dashboards, reports, advanced levels of customization, etc). 
3. Value-based pricing is set through an agreement between you and your client where they decide how much to pay you based on the value of your work for the company. 
4. The final way you could price your services is through a pay-for-results model where you don’t get paid if your services don’t improve the client’s business.

- As an entry-level data science consultant, you could look at charging between $200–250 per hour and begin charging upwards of $300 per hour as you gain more experience. 
- This will vary depending on the industry that you provide your unique services to, with a likely ability to increase your rate for clients in the oil and gas sector and a likely requirement to decrease your rate for small businesses.
