# 10 Differences Between Amateurs and Professional Analysts
(The journey to becoming a “real” data analyst)

## Difference #1 — Software skills
- Professional analysts push themselves to learn the most effective — fastest and most flexible — tools for the job, which means they rapidly transcend point-and-click analytics interfaces and learn to code. 
If they want to lay a claim to being a pro, they build scary-good skills in least two out of these three languages: R, Python, and SQL. 

## Difference #2 — Handling lots of data with ease
- Unlike a newbie, the professional analyst refuses to be daunted by dataset size. 
- If extra engineering skills are what it takes to handle it, so be it. You’ll learn whatever you must. 
- As a result, expert analysts often pick up data engineering skills along the way. Learn more.

## Difference #3 — Immunity to data science bias
- An expert analyst is that the expert has developed an all-encompassing disrespect for data. They never pronounce data with a capital ‘D’.
- Data can lull unsuspecting amateurs into a false sense of security, but experts know how to avoid quantitative gullibility. To start building the same immunity, stop treating data as special.

## Difference #4 - Understanding the career
- The professional analyst is an analyst by choice, not by misfortune. 
- To them, analytics is a discipline of excellence in its own right, not a stepping stone to some other profession
