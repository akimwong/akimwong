# 10 Differences Between Amateurs and Professional Analysts
(The journey to becoming a “real” data analyst)

## Difference #1 — Software skills
- Professional analysts push themselves to learn the most effective — fastest and most flexible — tools for the job, which means they rapidly transcend point-and-click analytics interfaces and learn to code. 
If they want to lay a claim to being a pro, they build scary-good skills in least two out of these three languages: R, Python, and SQL. 

## Difference #2 — Handling lots of data with ease
- Unlike a newbie, the professional analyst refuses to be daunted by dataset size. 
- If extra engineering skills are what it takes to handle it, so be it. You’ll learn whatever you must. 
- As a result, expert analysts often pick up data engineering skills along the way. 

## Difference #3 — Immunity to data science bias
- An expert analyst is that the expert has developed an all-encompassing disrespect for data. They never pronounce data with a capital ‘D’.
- Data can lull unsuspecting amateurs into a false sense of security, but experts know how to avoid quantitative gullibility. To start building the same immunity, stop treating data as special.

## Difference #4 - Understanding the career
- The professional analyst is an analyst by choice, not by misfortune. 
- To them, analytics is a discipline of excellence in its own right, not a stepping stone to some other profession
- What makes you an expert analyst is your expertise in exploration and inspiration—so that’s the best point of departure when pondering the nuances of the analytics career.

## Difference #5 — Refusing to be a data charlatan
- The first warning sign of a data charlatan is a failure to understand that analytics and statistics are very different disciplines. 
- Whatever your official job title, there’s no rule that says you can’t learn both trades if you want to… as long as you don’t get them confused.

## Difference #6 — Resistance to confirmation bias
- Confirmation bias means we can all look at the same number and perceive it differently.
- In other words, confirmation bias is the archnemesis of data-driven decision-making, since it means that a fact is no longer just a fact, no matter how much math and science you throw into getting it. It sucks all the value out of analyzing data.
- Put intentional practice into honing the best two skills for defending against confirmation bias: preregistration and open-mindedness in the face of apophenia.

## Difference #7 — Realistic expectations of data
- If you’re a professional analyst, you know that data doesn’t owe you anything. Not even decent quality for your troubles.
- Bad data is a professional reality for analysts, in large part because their work involves spending more time with secondary data than with primary data. 
- Analysts are painfully aware that you often need to start with bad data to figure out how to make better data.

## Difference #8 — Knowing how to add value
- If you’re a decision-maker hybrid, `your value is judged by the quality of your decisions and the actions you take`. 
- Your `analytical skills` are a means to that end — `analytics is just one of many weapons in your arsenal`.
- If you’re a pure analyst, your value is tied to your ability to serve your decision-maker. 
- A decision-maker’s job is to turn information into better action, which is hopeless if they can’t access much information. 
- That’s where the analyst comes in, `supporting their decision-maker’s information needs both reactively (by looking up data that answers their specific questions) and proactively (by exploring data to inspire them to consider new directions, making them more innovative and threat-proof)`.
- Expert analysts know that starting anywhere except with your decision-maker’s needs and priorities is bound to lead you astray.

## Difference #9 — Thinking differently about time
- A seasoned analyst understands that their work isn’t a sure thing with guaranteed results, but rather a time investment in inspiration, innovation, and early threat detection. 
- That’s why they seek bosses who understand this too — bosses who don’t punish them for coming back empty-handed.
- If they’re working for a savvy organization, their team trusts them to make the best possible use of the time that’s allotted to them, so they’re constantly thinking in terms of the potential time ROI of their actions.

## Difference #10 — Nuanced view of excellence
- Expert analysts don’t view speed as a dirty word but rather as a nuanced concept that guides how they think of their work, how they prioritize, how they assess performance, and how they develop their skills.
- As a professional analyst, speed is also your north star for skills development. 
- It’s true that the data landscape is changing rapidly, so you can’t afford to stagnate. 
- The tools you use today won’t stick around for long. Keep sharpening your claws, but don’t chase the buzzwords.
- `Stop asking: “Should I learn this tool/method/technique that all the cool kids are talking about?”  Start asking: “Will learning this make me faster?”`
- `Learn whatever makes you faster (in all the ways that matter). Since your work involves accelerating others, start by accelerating yourself`.

## Practice makes perfect!
- If all you’re after is a nudge to get started with analytics, go look at some numbers already.
