# Machine learning versus data science – demystifying the scene
(When it comes to machine learning versus data science, it’s helpful to know the differences and where to find common ground)

## Business machines play checkers
- Typically, machine learning algorithms learn from a portion of the data (the so-called ‘training set’) and then apply those settings to generalize previously unseen information. 
- These classical machine learning approaches form part of a data scientist’s toolkit. 
- However, `analytical roles don’t necessarily have to feature any machine learning whatsoever`.
- Data scientists may spend their days – at publications such as The Economist, The Guardian, The World Bank, or other information-heavy organizations – preparing data visualizations.

## Cleaning in progress
- A common task for data scientists, when faced with a new data set, is to carry out data cleaning and feature engineering.  This activity also brings human creativity into play – identifying ways of enriching existing data so that machine learning algorithms will be better able to cluster around key features.
- Smart-thinking data scientists are in demand for their skills across a wide range of applications. 
- Areas include helping companies boost profits by making sense of marketing data and customer analytics. 
- When talking about `machine learning versus data science, having humans in the loop can be a big value-add`. 
- `Computers are great at digesting billions of data points, but they lack creativity. However, pair the two and you have a powerful combination`.

## In Conclusion
<b>Machine learning:</b> Tends to refer to the use of a set of statistical algorithms to extract features from data and make predictions. 
<b>Data science:</b> Is the broad skill set required to make the most out of machine learning, bringing human curiosity and creativity to bear.
